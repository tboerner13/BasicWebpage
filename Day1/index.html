    <p>
        I have some interest in web development because I think that front-end design is important. A couple years ago, I would have had more interest in web development, but recently, I have changed my goals for my future. I plan on becoming a math teacher, but I still need to finish my degree in Computer Science. I may decide to teach Computer Science also, so it is important to me to be a well-rounded developer. I have done a lot of back-end programming, so learning more front-end will help to round out my skills.
