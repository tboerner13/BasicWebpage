    <p>Jack Sparrow, he is captain of the black pearl, evader of Davy Jones and Death itself, lover of rum, sometimes a good man, and always a pirate. Captain Jack has captured the hearts of many people over the past twenty years, and he will continue to live on as the greatest pirate we've ever seen, or at least, so it would seem. There will never be another pirate movie quite like <i>The Pirates of the Caribbean.</i> Ultimately, that is because there is no pirate quite like Captain Jack Sparrow, and he makes the films as great as they are.</p>
    <p>"I've got a jar of dirt!" - <span class="pirate">Captain Jack Sparrow</span></p>
    <p>You have so much more than that Captain, you have carried an entire franchise on your back, and they will never be able to replace you.</p>
